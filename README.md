I  build a complete serverless web application for a popular theme park called Innovator Island. The theme park is rolling out a mobile app that provides thousands of visitors with wait times, photo opportunities, notification alerts, and language translation for visitors who need it. In this project, I am  building a scalable serverless application with a single-page application (SPA) front-end that delivers a feature-rich user experience. I understand solid understanding of serverless concepts like event-driven computing and real time messaging, as well got practical hands-on experience deploying a serverless mobile front-end and using IoT to send messages to thousands of users in real time.
